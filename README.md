# Happiness Analysis

What is happiness? It feels like the primary goal for a human, yet many struggle to find it in our everyday lives. While many people attempt to work hard for it, countless are sucked into the endless grind for more money, eventually leaving them working solely for the money and forgetting what they were originally searching for.
